# Installation and Use

Once installed, `dailydose` gives access to the package's 4 special features: today's news in different fields (per Vox Media), random fun facts, and the games of hangman and battleship. The variety of the collection is inspired by the traditional newspaper/magazine experience, in which both information and thought-provoking entertainment is regularly provided. This package is ideal for any program that operates on changing content or stimulating applications. 

Upon running the package, a main menu is displayed in which your options are listed. Access each feature by entering their corresponding menu number.

## Newsfeed 
To see today's news, press 2 when the main menu is prompted. Immediately after, you will be given a list of options to read about: Culture, Politics, Science, World, Technology, Environment, and Business. You also have the option to return to the main menu. Select a field by entering the corresponding listed number. Today's top headlines in the chosen field, as published by Vox Media, as well as a link to read more are printed. The content is sourced from their website and therefore changes accordingly. Upon receiving the headlines, you will be redirected to the main menu.
